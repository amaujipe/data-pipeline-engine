## 📋 Project Overview

### Vision Statement

To create an open-source, enterprise-grade data pipeline engine that enables organizations to build, configure, and execute dynamic data processing workflows without requiring code deployment for each new use case.

### Key Features (Planned)

✨ **Dynamic Configuration** - Define pipelines through REST API calls, no code deployment needed  
🔧 **Extensible Architecture** - Plugin-based system for custom processors  
📊 **Schema Validation** - JSON Schema-based input/output validation  
📈 **Built-in Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics and execution tracking  
🔄 **Chain Processing** - Validator → Cleaner → Transformer pattern  
🐳 **Docker Ready** - Container-first deployment approach  
🏗️ **Clean Architecture** - Hexagonal architecture with DDD principles

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system follows **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design** principles:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   REST API      │    │  Application    │    │     Domain      │
│   Controllers   │───▶│   Use Cases     │───▶│     Models      │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Infrastructure  │    │   Persistence   │    │   Processors    │
│   Adapters      │◀───│   Repository    │◀───│   (Plugins)     │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Core Domain Concepts

- **Pipeline**: Orchestrates the complete data processing workflow
- **Processors**: Pluggable units (Validator, Cleaner, Transformer) that process data
- **Schema**: Defines data contracts using JSON Schema for validation
- **Execution**: Tracks pipeline runs with comprehensive metrics and error handling
