**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Document Type:** Ubiquitous Language Definition  
**Document Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

This glossary defines the **Ubiquitous Language** used throughout the Data Pipeline Engine project. All team members, documentation, code, and communications should use these terms consistently to ensure clear understanding and maintain domain alignment.

The terms are organized alphabetically with cross-references, examples, and relationships to support Domain-Driven Design principles.

---

## A

### **Aggregate**

**Definition:** A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit for data changes. Each aggregate has an aggregate root that controls access to the aggregate's components.

**Context:** In this system, `Pipeline` is the primary aggregate root that controls access to its `Processors`, `Schema` definitions, and `Executions`.

**Example:** A Pipeline aggregate ensures that all processors maintain proper ordering and configuration consistency.

**Related Terms:** [Aggregate Root](#aggregate-root), [Domain Model](#domain-model), [Pipeline](#pipeline)

### **Aggregate Root**

**Definition:** The only member of an aggregate that outside objects are allowed to hold references to. It serves as the single entry point for all operations on the aggregate.

**Context:** `Pipeline` is the aggregate root for the pipeline processing aggregate. All operations on processors, executions, and schema modifications go through the Pipeline.

**Example:** To add a processor to a pipeline, you must call `pipeline.addProcessor()` rather than directly manipulating the processor collection.

**Related Terms:** [Aggregate](#aggregate), [Pipeline](#pipeline), [Domain Model](#domain-model)

### **API (Application Programming Interface)**

**Definition:** A set of protocols and tools for building software applications. In this context, specifically refers to the REST API endpoints that allow external systems to interact with the pipeline engine.

**Context:** The REST API provides CRUD operations for pipelines, execution management, and monitoring capabilities.

**Example:** `POST /api/pipelines` creates a new pipeline configuration.

**Related Terms:** [REST API](#rest-api), [Endpoint](#endpoint)

---

## B

### **Batch Processing**

**Definition:** A method of processing data where a set of data records (a batch) is collected and processed together as a group, rather than processing records individually as they arrive.

**Context:** The pipeline engine processes data items in batches during execution, allowing for efficient resource utilization and transaction management.

**Example:** Processing 1,000 user records together in a single pipeline execution rather than 1,000 separate executions.

**Related Terms:** [Data Item](#data-item), [Execution](#execution), [Pipeline](#pipeline)

---

## C

### **Chain of Responsibility**

**Definition:** A behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

**Context:** Processors in a pipeline form a chain of responsibility where each processor handles the data and passes it to the next processor in sequence.

**Example:** Data flows through: Validator → Cleaner → Transformer, where each step can process or reject the data.

**Related Terms:** [Processor](#processor), [Pipeline](#pipeline), [Processing Chain](#processing-chain)

### **Cleaner**

**Definition:** A type of processor that performs data cleansing and normalization operations on data items. It removes inconsistencies, corrects errors, and standardizes data formats.

**Context:** One of the three built-in processor types in the system, specifically designed for data quality improvement.

**Example:** A Cleaner processor might trim whitespace, convert text to lowercase, or standardize phone number formats.

**Business Rules:**

- Must implement the Processor interface
- Should be idempotent (multiple applications produce same result)
- Cannot reject data items (unlike Validators)

**Related Terms:** [Processor](#processor), [Validator](#validator), [Transformer](#transformer), [Data Quality](#data-quality)

### **Configuration**

**Definition:** A set of parameters and settings that define how a component should behave. In this system, configurations are typically stored as JSON objects.

**Context:** Each processor has a configuration that defines its specific behavior, rules, and parameters.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {"field": "email", "operation": "LOWERCASE"},
    {"field": "name", "operation": "TRIM"}
  ]
}
```

**Related Terms:** [Processor](#processor), [Pipeline](#pipeline), [JSON Schema](#json-schema)

**Example:**

```json
{
  "id": "12345",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "age": 25,
  "name": "John Doe"
}
```
